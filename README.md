## Overview

This package provides an unsupervised (gold-standard label free)
phenotyping algorithm for electronic health record (EHR) data. The
algorithm combines the most predictive variable (surrogate), such as
count of the main International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes,
and other EHR features such as health utilization and processed clinical
note data, in order to obtain a score for accurate risk prediction as
well as disease classification. In particular, it normalizes the
surrogate to resemble gaussian mixture and leverages the remaining
features through random corruption denoising.

The data consists of : TO DO
